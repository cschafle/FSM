# FSM
Android application geared towards commemorating the Free Speech Movement at Cal through crowd sourced drawings and images that are uploaded via Flickr. This application also uses the Qualcomm Toq Watch.

STORY

My application, recognizes and responds to touch events depending on where the user is. If the user is on Sproul Plaza on the Berkeley Campus, their toq watch will receive a notification. This notificaiton will be any  of the six provided FSM leaders. (this notification is based on location and will pick a leader at Random) This notification will prompt them to open the toq app to a certain FSM leader. Upon clicking on this person's image, your phone will open to the FSM drawing portion of the app. Take a last look at the FSM leader's image! Underneath is a prompt with what to draw. After you pull out your phone, the app will already be opened for you. You have a choice of varied brush sizes, different eraser sizes, a save option, a delete option, different colors, and lastly an upload to flickr option. After uploading to flicker a new card will appear on your watch! However, it will take some time to get there (I did get  this to work, but it deleted all other cards, so to fix this I broke that and now its not working, it just adds a new card).

Additional features: eraser sizes, an option to start drawing over and a screen that pops up when the user is not in Sproul that directs the user to go to Sproul.

On the watch: even when you are not on Sproul the app has a deck of cards with an image of 6 FSM leaders. The app will only receive notifications on Sproul. Opening the app and selecting an image will trigger the phone drawing app to open.

The Phone: When on Sproul, you can upload as many photos as you want, however, outside of Sproul the phone will present a screen directing the user to go to Sproul. It will also allow the user to uninstall or install the toq app. Upon uploading to flickr, a new card will appear on the watch.
